## Deployment Guide

### Installing Apache Tomcat Server 8

Check the **JDK** used by default.

```
  sudo update-alternatives --config java
  error: no hay alternativas para java
```
Install JDK package with apt-get


```
  sudo apt-get install default-jdk -Y

```
Check the version of the installed JDK:

```
  java -version
  
  openjdk version "1.8.0_131"

```
For security purposes, Tomcat should be run as an unprivileged user (i.e. not root). We will create a new user and group that will run the Tomcat service.

First, create a new tomcat group:

```
 sudo groupadd tomcat
  
```

Next, create a new tomcat user. We'll make this user a member of the tomcat group, with a home directory of **/opt/tomcat** (where we will install Tomcat), and with a shell of **/bin/false** (so nobody can log into the account):

```
  sudo useradd -s /bin/false -g tomcat -d /opt/tomcat tomcat

```

Next, change to the **/tmp** directory on your server. This is a good directory to download ephemeral items, like the Tomcat tarball, which we won't need after extracting the Tomcat contents:

```
  cd /tmp
  
```

Use curl to download the link that you copied from the Tomcat website:

``` 
  curl -O "http://apache.rediris.es/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.20/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.20.tar.gz"
  
```

We will install Tomcat to the **/opt/tomcat** directory. Create the directory, then extract the archive to it with these commands:

```
  sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat
  sudo tar xzvf apache-tomcat-8*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1
  
```

The tomcat user that we set up needs to have access to the Tomcat installation. We'll set that up now.

Change to the directory where we unpacked the Tomcat installation:

```
  cd /opt/tomcat

```

Give the tomcat group ownership over the entire installation directory:

```
  sudo chgrp -R tomcat /opt/tomcat
  
```

Next, give the tomcat group read access to the conf directory and all of its contents, and execute access to the directory itself:

```
  sudo chmod -R g+r conf
  sudo chmod g+x conf

```

Make the tomcat user the owner of the webapps, work, temp, and logs directories:

```
  sudo chown -R tomcat webapps/ work/ temp/ logs/
```

Open a file called tomcat.service in the /etc/systemd/system directory by typing:

```
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service

```
Next, reload the systemd daemon so that it knows about our service file:

```
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  
```

Start the Tomcat service by typing:

```
  sudo systemctl start tomcat
  
```

Double check that it started without errors by typing:

```
  sudo systemctl status tomcat
  
```

If you were able to successfully accessed Tomcat, now is a good time to enable the service file so that Tomcat automatically starts at boot:

```
  sudo systemctl enable tomcat
  
```

In order to use the manager web app that comes with Tomcat, we must add a login to our Tomcat server. We will do this by editing the tomcat-users.xml file:

```
 sudo vi /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
 
```

You will want to add a user who can access the manager-gui and admin-gui (web apps that come with Tomcat). You can do so by defining a user:

```
 <tomcat-users>
     <user username="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
 </tomcat-users>
```

By default, newer versions of Tomcat restrict access to the Manager and Host Manager apps to connections coming from the server itself. Since we are installing on a remote machine, you will probably want to remove or alter this restriction. To change the IP address restrictions on these, open the appropriate context.xml files.

For the Manager app, type:

```
 
 sudo vi /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

```

For the Host Manager app, type:

```
 sudo vi /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml

```

Inside, comment out the IP address restriction to allow connections from anywhere. Alternatively, if you would like to allow access only to connections coming from your own IP address, you can add your public IP address to the list:

To put our changes into effect, restart the Tomcat service:

```
 sudo systemctl restart tomcat
 
```

### Installing MongoDB

MongoDB **is already included in Ubuntu package repositories**, but the official MongoDB repository provides the most up-to-date version and is the recommended way of installing the software. In this step, **we will add this official repository to our server.**

Ubuntu ensures the authenticity of software packages by verifying that they are signed with GPG keys, so we first have to import the key for the official MongoDB repository.

```
 sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6

```
Next, we'll add MongoDB repository details so apt will know where to download the packages. Issue the following command to create a list file for MongoDB.

```echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list```

Finally, we'll update the packages list.

```sudo apt-get update```
```echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list```

We'll install **the mongodb-org meta-package**, which includes the daemon, configuration and init scripts, shell, and management tools on the server.

``` sudo apt-get install mongodb-org -Y ```

Once the installation is complete, we'll start the **Mongo daemon**:

```sudo systemctl start mongod```

Since systemctl doesn't provide output, we'll check the status to verify that the service has started properly.

```sudo systemctl status mongod```

Press q to exit. Now that we've manually started the daemon and verified that it’s running, we'll ensure that it restarts automatically at boot:

```sudo systemctl enable mongod```


Encrypt data with Jasypt.

```
	java -cp ~/.m2/repository/org/jasypt/jasypt/1.9.2/jasypt-1.9.2.jar org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI input="PASSWORD" password=bisite00 algorithm=PBEWithMD5AndDES
	
```
